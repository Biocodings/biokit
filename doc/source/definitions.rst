    locus
        In a genomic contect, locus refers to position on a chromosome. It may, therefore, refer to a marker, a gene, or any other landmark that can be described.

    Accession number
        An Accession number is a unique identifier given to a sequence (e.g., FASTA) or protein (e.g., UniProt) when it is submitted to one of the DNA repositories (GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ). If the sequence is updated, the version number is incremented, but the Accession number will remain constant.
